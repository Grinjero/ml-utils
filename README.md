# Overview

This project should hopefully contain every piece of code that is not very domain specific (traffic, sales, etc.) and be
a repository of commonly needed functions.

The idea is to separate basic functionality by modules and then each module contains task specific implementations (
documenting for forecasting, evaluation of forecasting models, etc.)

Overview of modules can be found in the [`sphinx` autogenerated documentation](docs/build/html/index.html).
