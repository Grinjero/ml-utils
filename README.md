# Overview
This project should hopefully contain every piece of code that is not very domain specific (traffic, sales, etc.) and be 
a repository of commonly needed functions.

The general structure of the project and what each of the modules contain can be seen below. The idea is to separate basic functionality
by modules and then each module contains task specific implementations (documenting for forecasting, evaluation of 
forecasting models, etc.) 

For more information on specific functions read their descriptions.

## Documenting

## Evaluation
- `forecasting`
    - step_by_step_forecast

## Generators
- `window`


## Metrics
- `forecasting_metrics`


## Plotting
- `forecasting`
